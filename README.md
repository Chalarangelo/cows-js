# Cows.js
Chat over WebSockets using JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

* A computer with an internet connection (we recommend hosting the chat server only on LAN).
* A functioning installation of node.js and `npm`.
* Some basic knowledge of how to configure port forwarding, just in case (you might need to allow certain ports through the Windows Firewall or your router's firewall).
* Some people to chat with.

## Installation

* Grab the package by running: 
```
npm i cows-js
```

* If you want to start the server with the default configuration, you can just run:
```
npm run start
```

* If you feel like tinkering with the server parameters, run:
```
node ./dist/server.js --help
```
This will provide you with all the information you need on how to configure your server
